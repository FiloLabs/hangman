# Hangman
A cli program i wrote in python, and then made an installer and whatnot
## About
This project was made as a way to learn some basic Python
## Installing
### Windows
To install on Windows, it's recommended that you just download the [Installer](https://github.com/FiloLabs/hangman/raw/master/Windows/hangman_installer.exe) file.
However, if you for some reason prefer to download a standalone exe (no shortcuts/start menu entries) you can do that also.
You can also install from the [install.py](https://github.com/FiloLabs/hangman/blob/master/install.py) file.
### Linux
It's highly recommended to download the [install.py](https://github.com/FiloLabs/hangman/blob/master/install.py) file and run it with python3 install.py (DON'T USE SUDO!).

> Yes, there is an [install](https://github.com/FiloLabs/hangman/raw/master/Linux/install) file, but if you do run it, you absolutely have to make sure that you select 'Run in terminal'; if you merely run the program it won't do anything (It will send a message you can't see, and wait for confirmation -_- )

Here's a handy command to download the install.py file to the desktop and then run it:
`cd ~/Desktop && curl -LJO https://github.com/FiloLabs/hangman/raw/master/install.py && clear && python3 install.py`

P.S. jvadair is me - I'm too lazy to change the title to FiloLabs, plus thats longer and wouldn't neccessarily fit as ascii on the intro screen. And I just didn't think of it at the time.
##Run online
The game is meant to be installed and played offline, however, thanks to some random online tool I found, you can now also play it in your web browser.
